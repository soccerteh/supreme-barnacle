    <description>The daily scheduled Lead Age Scoring flow creates a Lead Age Scoring platform event record which subsequently triggers the Lead Age Scoring Event flow. There is a field on this platform event labeled &#39;Lead Count&#39; which is set to &#39;0&#39; each morning via the scheduled flow. This essentially resets the counter daily.</description>
