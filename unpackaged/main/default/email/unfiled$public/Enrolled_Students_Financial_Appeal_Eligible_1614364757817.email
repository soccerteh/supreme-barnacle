<br />
Thank you for submitting your Financial Appeal. At this time, our Financial Services team has reviewed your appeal and found your case eligible for appeal, based on the information submitted.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The withdrawal and refund schedule as presented on the <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/payment-cancellation-policy/">Payment &amp; Cancellation Policy</a> and the <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/withdrawal-financial-appeal-policies/">Withdrawal &amp; Financial Appeal Policy</a> ensures that Verto Education is able to pay non-refundable student costs for programs, including, but not limited to, accommodation, food, travel, instructors, and included activities. Due to these costs being unrecoverable after 60 days, refunds are partially issued between 60 and 30 days and not able to be issued within 30 days of the program start date. Deposits are non-refundable.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With that being said, it is always our first priority to ensure student wellbeing and to abide by our mission to develop valuable experiential programming for students. Based on the supporting details and documentation submitted, you have qualified for financial appeal.<br />
