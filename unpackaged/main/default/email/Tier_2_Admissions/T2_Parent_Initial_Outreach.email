Hi {!Opportunity.Z_Parent_1_First_Name__c},

{!Opportunity.z_First_Name__c} has taken the initiative to begin an application to Verto Education, and we just wrapped up a wonderful interview. College is certainly a big decision, so it's always best when families are on the same page. Would it be possible to set up a family call? Please let me know if there's a time tomorrow or the next day that would work best for you.

As you discuss Verto Education with {!Opportunity.z_First_Name__c}, hereâ€™s a brief overview of how Verto works to launch students' college careers with immersive semesters: 

Verto is a first semester (or year) of college abroad, with direct admission to 50+ colleges and universities. It's more affordable than your typical semester of college and can get your student admitted to at least one of our 50+ partner colleges (William & Mary, Bucknell, University of Vermont, University of Oregon, Temple University, and more). They will also get a full load of college credits to transfer to any school of their choice, including colleges that are not Verto partners.

Many families are wondering about college in these uncertain times. Verto is more well-equipped and likely to offer amazing, in-person semesters than most other institution of higher learning. Here are some documents that will help answer questions most parents are asking at this time: vertoeducation.org/scenario-plan/. We also offer an Enrollment Guarantee; if for any reason Verto is not able to run the semester location that {!Opportunity.z_First_Name__c} signed up for, your family can switch to one of our other locations or receive a refund. We are confident that Verto will provide a secure, impactful launch to college for {!Opportunity.z_First_Name__c}!

If you have further questions before our call, please reply to this email or arrange a meeting with me using my scheduling link. Here is a link to sign up for our upcoming Virtual Open House, where you can speak with recent Verto alumni and our financial aid and college counseling team: https://vertoeducation.org/open-house

This quick video does a nice job of outlining our model: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFaOfZ4Amm8

I Iook forward to speaking with you and {!Opportunity.z_First_Name__c} in more detail during our upcoming group call, and during our call we can cover program experience, tuition/scholarships, safety, and anything else on your mind. 
 
All my best, 
{!Opportunity.OwnerFullName}
