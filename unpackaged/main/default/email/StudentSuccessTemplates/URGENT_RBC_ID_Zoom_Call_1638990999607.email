<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
I am reaching out to request a short Zoom call with you in order to get a Richard Bland College student ID emailed or mailed to you by next week. We need to complete the following steps, as a student ID can be used for state identification in the state of Virginia:
<ul>
	<li>Complete a short, recorded Zoom call where I can see your face, and you are able to produce a state or federally-issued form of identification (driver's license or passport).</li>
	<li>I share this information with Richard Bland College and they produce the student ID.</li>
	<li>Richard Bland College sends the ID to you electronically or via mail.</li>
</ul>

<p>This ID is necessary to apply for an Italian Student Visa for the spring 2022 term. Please schedule this call with me ASAP and let me know if your availability (as you are currently overseas) does not match with mind - I will make sure to find a time that meets your schedule.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
Stuart<br />
