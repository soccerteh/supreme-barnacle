I am writing to let you know that you have been withdrawn from your Verto Education semester due to your failure to respond to outreach and engage in the pre-departure onboarding process.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please note that your $500 deposit is nonrefundable.&nbsp; I encourage you to review our <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/payment-cancellation-policy/#gref">payment and cancellation policy here</a>.<br />
