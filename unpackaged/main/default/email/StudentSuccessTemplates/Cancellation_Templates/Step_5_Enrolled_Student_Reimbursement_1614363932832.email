<br />
We've received a request from your Verto Student Success Coach,&nbsp;{{{Enrollment_Record__c.Owner__c}}} that your Semester Withdrawal request has been submitted and approved. As a member of Verto's Financial Services team, I have now begun the process of your reimbursement in accordance with our <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/payment-cancellation-policy/">Payment &amp; Cancellation Policy</a> and our <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/withdrawal-financial-appeal-policies/">Withdrawal &amp; Financial Appeal policy</a>.<br />
<br />
After processing the request, I'm pleased to verify that you will receive a refund of xx for tuition and fees paid. This will be reimbursed to you via check/direct disbursement, so please look out for that.<br />
<br />
We wish you the best in the rest of your college career!&nbsp;<br />
