<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you again so much for taking the time to speak with me today! I am looking forward to working with you as we prepare for your adventure with Verto.&nbsp; To get started with the pre-departure process, please review the next steps and resources included in this email.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://vertoeducation.org/community-events/"><b>VERTO VIRTUAL EVENTS</b></a> <b>: </b>this is a link to all of our virtual events.&nbsp; These events will provide you with important information leading up to your semester and <b>some are mandatory</b>! Make sure you are checking this page or the event section of your student portal to register for these important events!<br />
<br />
<b>YOUR VERTO COLLEGE COUNSELOR</b>&nbsp;<b>:&nbsp;</b>your college counselor is&nbsp;{{{Enrollment_Record__c.College_Counselor__c}}}.&nbsp; They will be in touch with you soon and will help you with your post-Verto plans!<br />
<br />
<a href="https://vertoeducation.campusgroups.com/login_only"><b>VERTO STUDENT PORTAL</b></a> <b>:</b> the <b>Student Portal&nbsp;</b>is going to be your hub for all important information and action items leading up to your semester!&nbsp; Be sure to <b>bookmark it now</b> and spend sometime exploring it.&nbsp; Here, you will complete your important action items, connect with other students, and sign up for important pre-departure events.&nbsp;
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br />
<b>SET UP YOUR PORTAL ACCOUNT AND DOWNLOAD THE APP</b><br />
<br />
You should have received an email from Campus Groups inviting you to set up your account in the Student Portal.&nbsp; Sometimes this email goes to spam folders, so if you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam (if you still don't see it, let me know)!&nbsp; Once you've set up your account, you will be able to start working on your action items, signing up for events, and meeting other students in your program!<br />
<br />
You can also&nbsp;use the portal through our Student Portal app.&nbsp; To <b>download the app</b>, go to your app store and search&nbsp;<b>Verto Education Student Portal.&nbsp;</b>Once you've downloaded the app, login and start working on your action items!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>ACCESS YOUR CHECKLIST</b><br />
<br />
The checklist section of the student portal is going to be the most important place for you to prepare for your semester.&nbsp; Keep in mind that&nbsp;<b>you must complete all checklist items to be able to go on your semester!</b></div>
