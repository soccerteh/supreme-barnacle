<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}} and family,<br />
<br />
Thank you for continuing with Verto for the spring 2022 term in Italy! As you already know, I am working on assisting students that need to apply for an Italian Student Visa during the winter break before departing for the new program in Italy. This process is detailed, but thankfully it does not take very long. There are several items we can complete before students return to the U.S. for the winter break, after which point we will collect their passports in the completed visa packet and mail them to the central Italian Consulate in Philadelphia. The steps are as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Please review the attached documents. The attachment "Philadelphia - Student Visa Checklist (SP22).pdf" outlines the various documents we will need to collect before we send them in to the consulate for processing. The attachments are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Philadelphia - Student Visa Checklist (SP22).pdf</li>
		<li>Philadelphia - National Visa Application (SP22).pdf</li>
		<li>Los Angeles - SAMPLE VERTO ITALIAN VISA APPLICATION.pdf&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>I have already requested a "Proof of Enrollment Letter" from our partners in Florence and Richard Bland College, which will be mailed via courier service (UPS from Italy and USPS Priority Mail from RBC) to the home address you have on file. <b>Please let me know if your mailing address has changed:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>{{{Recipient.MailingAddress}}}&nbsp;</li>
		<li>You will receive two letters in Italian from Florence, and one letter in English from RBC.</li>
		<li>Keep these letters, as the originals must be mailed with the visa application.</li>
		<li>The letter from Italy will also double as the "proof of accommodation/lodging," so you will not need another letter for that checklist item.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Parents:&nbsp;</i></b>Complete the visa application using the information in the attached "Visa guide"
	<ul>
		<li><b>DO NOT SIGN - student's (applicant's) signature must happen in front of a notary public</b></li>
		<li>Program dates will be February 2, 2022 - May 6, 2022 (93 days), or your own travel dates that reflect your purchased airfare.</li>
		<li><b>Use the "Los Angeles - SAMPLE VERTO ITALIAN VISA APPLICATION.pdf" for application details (sponsor, addresses in Italy, etc)</b></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Parents:&nbsp;</i></b>Collect "Proof of Financial Support" documentation showing $35/day ($3,255 total) in one of the following formats, per the checklist:
	<ul>
		<li><b>If student is financial responsible:</b> An original/standard bank statement or a letter on the bank’s letterhead, signed by a bank official and with recent date, indicating account balance. (at least $35 per day of stay in Italy is required, in accordance with the means of support guidelines)</li>
		<li><b>If parents are financially responsible: </b>submit their Notarized Affidavit of financial support (notarization must be done on the same document) stating their financial commitment for expenses incurred in Italy. A letter or bank statement from their bank, in the bank’s letterhead, signed by a bank official and with a recent date, indicating account balance. (at least $35 per day of stay in Italy is required, in accordance with the means of support guidelines);</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Parents:&nbsp;</i></b>Purchase airfare for the program -&nbsp;<b>purchased</b>&nbsp;airfare is required to submit the visa application. Print out your flight plan that shows a confirmation number for the flight to include in the packet.</li>
	<li>I will be registering you for CISI insurance. You will receive email confirmation of this, and I will CC your parents on the message.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><b><i>Parents:&nbsp;</i></b>You will need to print out the "Consulate letter" attachment from the CISI email and the ID card.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b><i>Parents:&nbsp;</i></b>Obtain a $59 USPS money order. You must use a USPS money order, not a bank money order or cashier's check.
	<ul>
		<li>The money order must be made out to the "Consulate General of Italy"</li>
		<li>The money order must be from the student/applicant, with their&nbsp;<b>full legal name and address.</b></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
You'll notice that a copy of your driver's license or nondriver's ID is required. This is meant to confirm residency to apply to your region's Italian Consulate. In place of this, I am getting digital student IDs sent from Richard Bland College. This will require that you, the student, schedule a 5-minute Zoom call with me to confirm your identity. I have to record these calls and share them with RBC to confirm your identity. <b>The RBC student ID is necessary to apply to the Philadelphia Consulate, as RBC is in the Philadelphia jurisdiction.&nbsp;</b>This can only be shared with the student, so please make sure you share this with your family when you receive it. It likely won't arrive until you return to the US.<br />
<br />
I would recommend getting a FedEx envelope to keep these documents in, as that is how I would recommend mailing the entire application packet once it is finished. FedEx is a little more reliable (I'm not certain why) in mailing to the consulate in Philadelphia.<br />
<br />
<b>One last thing:</b>&nbsp;I have scheduled 3 "office hour" sessions next week to go over the visa application with each of you. I'm happy to schedule them separately and also happy to review them as a group on the following dates. No need to RSVP - just show up! And if none of these times work, let me know and we'll find another time!
