<div><a href="https://vertoeducation.campusgroups.com/login_only"><b>VERTO STUDENT PORTAL</b></a>&nbsp;<b>:</b>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<b>Student Portal&nbsp;</b>is going to be your hub for all important information and action items leading up to your semester!&nbsp; Be sure to&nbsp;<b>bookmark it now</b>&nbsp;and spend sometime exploring it.&nbsp; Here, you will complete your important action items, connect with other students, and sign up for important pre-departure events.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<b>SET UP YOUR PORTAL ACCOUNT AND DOWNLOAD THE APP</b><br />
<br />
You should have received an email from Campus Groups inviting you to set up your account in the Student Portal.&nbsp; Sometimes this email goes to spam folders, so if you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam (if you still don't see it, let me know)!&nbsp; Once you've set up your account, you will be able to start working on your action items, signing up for events, and meeting other students in your program!<br />
<br />
You can also&nbsp;use the portal through our Student Portal app.&nbsp; To&nbsp;<b>download the app</b>, go to your app store and search&nbsp;<b>Verto Education Student Portal.&nbsp;</b>Once you've downloaded the app, login and start working on your action items!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>ACCESS YOUR CHECKLIST</b><br />
<br />
The checklist section of the student portal is going to be the most important place for you to prepare for your semester.&nbsp; Keep in mind that&nbsp;<b>you must complete all checklist items to be able to go on your semester!</b><br />
