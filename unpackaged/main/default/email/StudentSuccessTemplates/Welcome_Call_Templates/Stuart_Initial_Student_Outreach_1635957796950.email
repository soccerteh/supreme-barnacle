<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Congratulations on joining the Verto family!&nbsp; My name is&nbsp;{{{Sender.FirstName}}} and I will be your Student Onboarding Advisor.&nbsp; This means that from now until you depart for your semester, I am going to be your primary point of contact and guide as we prepare for your semester.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>YOUR FIRST ACTION ITEM:&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
To get started, please <a href="https://calendly.com/stuart-rb/new-student-welcome-call-clone"><b>schedule a Welcome Call</b></a>&nbsp;(will be scheduled in Zoom - be sure to choose a time where you're able to chat with a computer in front of you!) with me! This call is a great opportunity for us to get to know each other a bit better. We will discuss the onboarding process, your goals for the semester, and go over any questions that you may have.&nbsp; Please make sure that you have a notebook or laptop on hand to take notes and review the student portal (Campus Groups, as described below) checklist. Please let me know if you do not have your login information to the student portal ASAP!<br />
