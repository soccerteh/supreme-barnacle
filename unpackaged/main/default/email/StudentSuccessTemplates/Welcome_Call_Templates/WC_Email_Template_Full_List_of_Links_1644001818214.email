<br />
You should have received an email from Campus Groups inviting you to set up your account in the Student Portal.&nbsp; Sometimes this email goes to spam folders, so if you don't see it in your inbox, check your spam (if you still don't see it, let me know)!&nbsp; Once you've set up your account, you will be able to start working on your action items, signing up for events, and meeting other students in your program!<br />
<br />

The checklist section of the student portal is going to be the most important place for you to prepare for your semester.&nbsp; Keep in mind that&nbsp;<b>you must complete all checklist items to be able to go on your semester!</b><br />
