Congratulations on joining the&nbsp;{{{Enrollment_Record__c.Program__c}}} program! I'm excited to speak with you and welcome you to Verto. My name is Stuart Robbins-Butcher, and I will be your Student Onboarding Adviser throughout the pre-departure period - everything from registering with our school of record, registering for classes, purchasing airfare, and preparing for your semester will come from me or the Student Onboarding Team.&nbsp;<br />

I look forward to meeting with you - please use the following link to schedule a time to speak that works for you. I will call you at your number on your Verto application.
