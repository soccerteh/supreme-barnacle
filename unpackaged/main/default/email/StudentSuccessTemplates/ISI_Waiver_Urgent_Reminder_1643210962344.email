<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Dear Emily,<br />
<br />
I have been notified by our onsite staff in Florence that you have not complete the ISI Waiver &amp; Student Information Forms that are required to participate in the program. This form must be complete prior to your arrival, so I highly recommend that you complete it today if possible. We work with a logistics partner that assists with housing and classroom space in Florence, so it's required that students complete their required forms in addition to Verto's. Thanks for your diligence in completing this ASAP -&nbsp;https://isiflorence.org/verto-student-info-form-waivers/.<br />
<br />
If this form is not complete prior to departure, you will not be allowed in student housing or the study center in Florence. Please complete it today!<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
Stuart<br />
