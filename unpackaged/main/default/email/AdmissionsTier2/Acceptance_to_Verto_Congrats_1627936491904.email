Dear _____,<br />
<br />
Congratulations! After reviewing your application, the entire Verto Admissions Committee and I believe you'll be an incredible addition to Verto, which includes adventurous students from around the country and the world. I know that you will create lifelong memories during this academically and personally enriching experience. We are confident that you will purposefully immerse yourself within diverse cultures and environments, thrive within Verto's academic model of hands-on, experiential learning and forge friendships with the worldwide Verto community.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next step is to reserve your spot in the semester location of your choice. The $500 enrollment deposit can be submitted here <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/deposit">https://vertoeducation.org/deposit</a> . The deposit goes towards your tuition and is not a separate fee. With Verto's Enrollment Guarantee <a href="https://vertoeducation.org/verto-education/enrollment-guarantee/">https://vertoeducation.org/verto-education/enrollment-guarantee/</a>, you have peace of mind when depositing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering that final arrangements are being made for the semester now, the decision to enroll must be made at your earliest convenience. Once enrolled, a Student Success Coach will work closely with your family on all the matters related to the upcoming semester, including flights, coursework, and pre-departure family orientations.
